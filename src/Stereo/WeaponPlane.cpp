// EVERY DRAW ITEM THROUGH THE SCENE PLANE.
//
// The first-person plane (ERenderingPlane::RPl_Weapon) is not a property the renderer reads off a
// mesh -- it is a per-item bit that selects which of the view's parameter blocks the item is drawn
// with. Measured by disassembly 2026-09-02: the multiply by the block stride 0x3A0 occurs exactly
// ONCE in the whole executable, in sub_14023A938, and the branch above it is the entire mechanism
// (see PLANE_ROUTE_BRANCH_RVA in EngineRvas.hpp for the four instructions).
//
// WHY THE WEAPON PLANE EXISTS, so the trade is made with open eyes:
//
//   * its own near plane. The gun sits 20-40 cm from the eye. Read out of the capture's depth
//     target, the whole first-person plane -- forearms and weapon alike -- lands in a narrow band
//     around 0.906, while a scene object at 30 cm would write about 0.33 in the same reversed-Z
//     buffer. That remap is what stops the gun clipping through the near plane and z-fighting.
//   * it never intersects the world, so the barrel does not poke through a wall you stand against.
//   * its own field of view, independent of the camera's -- which matters doubly in this port,
//     where the camera FOV is forced past 100.
//
// WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN THIS IS ON -- looked at on screen 2026-09-02, and it is NOT what the
// paragraph above predicts. Nothing changes: the weapon gains no world depth, it is not cut by the
// near plane, its field of view does not move. So the 0x3A0 block this branch selects does not carry
// the projection, and the first-person plane is separated somewhere else. Where that separation is
// visible: the early 67-draw pass that draws the arms and the gun (events 17404..17871 in
// outlinedmagazineandweaponnotoutlined.rdc), whose depth all lands in a narrow band around 0.906
// while a scene object at 30 cm would write about 0.33 in the same reversed-Z buffer. What buckets a
// draw item into that pass is the open question.
//
// The knob is kept because it is proven, reversible and free, and because it is the only lever on
// plane routing this binary has -- but it is not, on this evidence, a way to move the weapon into
// the scene.
//
// It is therefore a LIVE KEY WITH A DEFAULT OF 0. Off, this file touches nothing at all: the branch
// is left exactly as the game shipped it, and the patch is reverted the moment the key goes back to
// zero, so the comparison can be made in one session without a relaunch.
//
// The patch is validated before it is written and before it is reverted -- if the bytes are not the
// ones this file was written against (a game update, another mod ahead of us), nothing is touched
// and the reason is logged once. Never patch an instruction you have not just read.

// scene), and the collection at PLANE_FILTER_JNZ_RVA drops every object whose byte does not match
// the plane being gathered.

// the proxy's plane puts every item on the scene pile, which is the pile the highlight gather walks --
// so a weapon in the hand becomes outlineable without touching a single item.
//
// What it costs is not known from measurement and should not be guessed at: forcing the scene
// parameter block (the routing knob above) changed nothing on screen, and moving one katana to the
// scene plane by event looked fine, so the usual first-person-plane arguments -- wall clipping, near
// plane, its own field of view -- are not evidenced here. Default 0 all the same, because this moves
