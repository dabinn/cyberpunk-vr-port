// BodyYawCensus -- WHEN the body's yaw is computed, relative to the animation pass that draws it.
//
// WHAT THIS SITE IS. `sub_140336390` is the function that computes the player's body yaw and stores
// it as a pure-yaw quaternion into its state at `+0x1D0` (position at `+0x1C0`, same fixed-point
// scale `dword_1431EEE78` the camera path uses). Found live, 2026-08-13: a hardware write watchpoint
// walked from the drawn body's world quaternion up through the propagation --
//   sub_1401D74FC SetWorldTransform  <- sub_1401D9528 (binding loop)  <- sub_141CA3720
//   sub_1401D8558 UpdateWorldTransforms <- sub_14068E1F8 <- sub_1401C9430 <- sub_140B53E3C
// -- and everything below this site only COPIES the value. See docs/vrik-map.md §6.
//
// WHY IT IS MEASURED HERE AND NOT ARGUED ABOUT. The body and the camera turn by the SAME number
// (measured: entity yaw == view heading to five digits), so the double on a fast mouse flick cannot
// be a second rotation -- it can only be a difference of INSTANTS: the pose was baked with the yaw
// of one frame while the view was drawn with the yaw of the next. That question has exactly two
// answers and they lead to opposite work:
//   * the yaw is computed BEFORE the animation batch -> the solve can read the fresh value and the
//     double is ours to remove;
//   * the yaw is computed AFTER it -> the pose of that frame is already consumed, and no bone write
//     can reach the frame being drawn (which is what the old root-pre-rotation experiment found).
// The instrument therefore reports the gap in milliseconds AND the disagreement in degrees against
// the yaw this site actually wrote -- the degrees do not depend on the CET push at all, so they
// close the one caveat the [bodyyaw] census still had.
//
// PATCH SAFETY. The site is patched the same way PatchCamera patches the camera write: the original
// instruction runs first, then a stub saves the volatile registers AND xmm0-xmm3 before calling into
// C++ -- this function passes floats in xmm registers, so a plain MinHook detour on its entry could
// clobber arguments. The 17-byte pattern was checked against the exe on disk: ONE match (the 8-byte
// write instruction alone matches twice, so the longer form is required).
