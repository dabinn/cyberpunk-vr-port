// WheelGrab -- give the arm back to the driving animation, and steer with your hands.
//
// Ported from iPowerTech's fork (425d4262 "wip motioncontroller vehicle steering" and 51861118
// "Shoot while you drive, steering deadzone, steering sensitivity, VR Horn"), which was written
// against 0.1.1 -- before this tree was restructured and before the dxgi proxy was retired. The
// grab, animation handoff and horn originate there. Steering now calibrates at
// the grab position and integrates signed frame-to-frame rotation; see WheelSteering.hpp.
// Settings are read from g_liveControls and state stays inside this plugin.
//
// THE IDEA, and it is the whole reason this works everywhere: driving, the engine ALREADY animates
// both hands onto the wheel (or the handlebars), and that pose is sitting in the bone buffer on every
// fresh solve before we touch anything. So there is no steering wheel to find, no vehicle bone to
// resolve and no per-model offset table -- the reference pose IS the animation, which is why the same
// code works on a bike, in any car, and in vehicles this port has never seen.
//
// Per hand, independently: bring a hand to where the animation holds the wheel, squeeze that grip,
// and the arm is handed back to the animation (fingers included -- VRIK never writes finger bones, so
// the native grip comes for free). Release the grip and the arm returns to the controller. The other
// hand is unaffected, so you can hold the wheel with one hand and keep the other on a gun.
//
// Handing an arm back means three writes must stop TOGETHER, not just the IK solve:
//   * VRIK_SolveArm              -- the rotations
//   * VRIK_ScaleArmBonesFromRest -- the segment lengths scaled to the player's real arm; leave them
//                                  in and the hand lands next to the wheel, not on it
//   * the solve cache            -- the same-tick replay would re-apply the last solved locals 4-5x
//                                  per tick and glue the arm right back where it was
// and the two translation writes that are NOT reverted by the engine (the length scale and the
// shoulder protraction) have to be put back to the rig's rest values on the way out. That is what
// VRIK_RestoreArmRestTrans in src/Anim/CharacterRig.cpp does.

// animation's CLOSED FISTS are on the avatar the whole time you are seated, wheel held or not: hands
// following your controllers around the cabin with the knuckles of someone still gripping a wheel
// that is not there.
//
// So the fingers need a pose of their own for the not-holding case, and the honest source for one is
// the player: latch the finger locals while ON FOOT with empty hands -- the game's own relaxed hand
// -- and replay them for whichever hand is not on the wheel. Nothing authored, nothing hardcoded per
// rig, and it tracks whatever the character's idle hand actually is.
