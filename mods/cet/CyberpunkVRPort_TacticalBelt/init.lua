-- CyberpunkVRPort_TacticalBelt -- the belt the player always wears, and what hangs on it.
--
-- WHY A BELT AT ALL. The port has run out of buttons. Everything a hand can do physically -- draw the
-- magazine, rack the slide, reach for the holster -- was won back from a button, and grenades, spare
-- magazines and the rest still live on a wheel. A belt is where those things go in real life, so it is
-- where they should go here: an object at the waist that the hand reaches for.
--
-- WHY IT IS AN EQUIPMENTEX ITEM AND NOT A COMPONENT ON THE PLAYER TEMPLATE. Baking meshes into
-- `player_ma_fpp.ent` is this port's own trick for the VRCAM cameras and the held-object carriers, and it
-- was the first thing tried here. It is the wrong tool for clothing: EquipmentEx owns the wardrobe in
-- this setup, the belt declares `OutfitSlots.Waist` in its own TweakDB record, and going through that
-- slot gets garment support, the body-type mesh variants ArchiveXL substitutes for garment items only,
-- and a wardrobe entry the player already understands. A hand-placed skinned mesh gets none of it and
-- clips through whatever is actually being worn.
--
-- WHY LUA AND NOT REDSCRIPT. Calling EquipmentEx from redscript makes it a COMPILE-TIME dependency, and
-- a redscript file that fails to compile switches off every redscript mod in the game, not just itself.
-- From here the outfit system is looked up by name and a missing EquipmentEx is simply a nil -- the mod
-- stands down and says so, which is this port's rule for anything that can be absent. Lua also reaches
-- the two things this needs and redscript does not: a component's RTTI properties, and Codeware's
-- per-component ChangeAppearance.
--
-- HOW THE PIECES MOVE (read off the asset, not guessed):
--
--   the item          Items.ucbelt_d / _e / _f  -- black / green / FDE tan, each WITH accessories
--                     (a/b/c are the same three colours with the pouches stripped, and they carry no
--                     separate components to toggle, so they are no use here)
--   the entity        base\ezio\ucbelt\ucbelt_group.ent -> ucbeltacc.ent, which carries SEVEN separate
--                     entGarmentSkinnedMeshComponents, one per element -- which is what makes an element
--                     switchable at all:
--
--                       ucbeltacc          the strap itself
--                       ucbeltmag          magazine pouch     front-left,  9 x 7 x 10 cm
--                       ucbeltsoftpouch    small soft pouch   front-right, 6 x 7 x 8 cm
--                       ucbelthardpouch    hard case          right side, 17 x 31 x 11 cm
--                       ucbeltdualpouch    twin pouch         rear, 37 x 24 x 9 cm
--                       ucbeltbagpouch     bag                rear-left,  13 x 10 x 9 cm
--                       ucbeltradio        radio              right hip,   3 x 7 x 17 cm
--
--   the colour        every element mesh carries appearance_01 (black), _02 (green), _03 (FDE tan), so
--                     the colour is a per-component appearance and changes with no unequip.
--
-- The sizes above are the meshes' own bounding boxes in bind pose (male body; the female meshes sit
-- about 8 cm higher and are ~15% narrower). They are written down here because the reach-for-an-element
-- step will need them, and measuring them twice is waste.

    --   the first-person plane draws over the body the way the gun and the arms do, which is what a
    --   thing on your belt should look like in VR -- and nothing there can be outlined.
    --
    -- A LIGHT does not care about the plane. Every prop carries one, `vrp_glow`, baked in by
    -- tools/ent/add_prop_light.py and shipped switched off; the belt toggles it on the same proximity
    -- decision the outline uses. No HUD claim, no renewal timer, no transition to restart, and none
    -- of the glitch intro the fill style plays.

    -- the first-person plane. Every prop mesh is our own copy carrying a second appearance, `lit`,
    -- whose material is CDPR's own emissive shader in white (tools/make_glow_meshes.py); switching it
    -- is one ChangeAppearance per mesh component, with no HUD claim, no renewal, no fade and no plane
    -- to satisfy.
    --
    -- 3 = the light component, kept because it is built and reversible, but it is a light SOURCE: it
    -- lights the thigh and the clothes rather than the prop itself. That is what "это свет от неё, а
    -- не свет на ней" named, and it is why it is not the default.
    -- THE PLANE IS NOT A CHOICE. It follows the player, and there is no knob for it: while the weapon
    -- is holstered the props are in the scene with everything else, and the moment a weapon comes out
    -- they go to RPl_Weapon with the gun and the arms. The instruction, verbatim: "когда игрок сцена -

    -- Every prop draws through PLAIN entMeshComponent copies, and that is not incidental: a skinned
    -- component needs a live skeleton and draws nothing standalone, which is the whole reason the
    -- grenade was invisible to begin with. So the subscription had nowhere to land, and because the
    -- write went through a pcall it failed in silence and read like a working mechanism.
    --
    -- What the plain component does have is the plain `renderingPlane` enum, so the port drives it
    -- itself: read the plane the player is actually in, write it onto the prop's components. Pinning
    -- the plane at the attach instead is what produced both halves of the old problem:
    -- pinned to the scene, the drawn gun composites over the prop; pinned to RPl_Weapon, the prop is
    -- drawn over the body forever, including in the states where the player is not in that plane.

-- A ROW OF IDENTICAL PIECES IS ONE THING, not three.
--
-- Three shells side by side are one holder: they are tuned together, they light together, and giving
-- each its own sliders would only be a way to break the row apart. Each member names the leader whose
-- sliders it follows; the leader is an ordinary host and knows nothing about them.
--
-- The spacing itself is NOT here -- it is baked into the three meshes, 2.7 cm apart, because a
-- component transform on a skinned part does not survive the camera. Changing the spacing means
-- re-baking the row, which is three lines of arithmetic in the deploy.
-- EVERY FIREARM IN THE GAME, by the piece of its record name that names the model.
--
-- The belt carries the magazine of the weapon the player actually has -- "чтобы для каждого оружия
-- он был свой - иначе херня" -- so there is one component and one mesh per entry here, each the
-- weapon's OWN magazine re-bound to the hips. The list was read off the archives rather than written
-- by hand (tools/build_belt_mags.py), which is how it went from the twenty-four I first guessed at to
-- the fifty-one that exist.
--
-- Longest first: `senkoh` has to be tried before `nue` would match something that is not a Nue.
--
-- Missing on purpose: the Defender's magazine mesh carries no bones at all, so there is nothing to
-- bind to the hips and no belt copy of it exists.

-- ATTACHED, NOT "EQUIPPED", and the difference matters.
--
-- EquipmentEx's public EquipItem() would do this in one call, but it also calls Activate() on the way
-- in, and Activate() is a wardrobe MODE: it clears the visuals of every base clothing slot and clones
-- what the player is wearing into outfit slots. The player looks the same afterwards, but from then on
-- changing clothes in the inventory does not change what is drawn until they go through the outfit
-- wardrobe. That is a real change to how the player's game works, and it is not what "put a belt on the
-- player" should cost.
--
-- What EquipmentEx also does -- and this is the part worth using -- is add every OutfitSlots.* record to
-- the PLAYER CHARACTER's own `attachmentSlots` (EquipmentEx.reds:2295, a TweakDB batch over every
-- Character_Record whose entity template is a player one). So OutfitSlots.Waist is a genuine attachment
-- slot on the player, and an item can be put in it with the engine's own TransactionSystem, with no
-- outfit mode and nothing else touched.
--
-- The item is a PREVIEW item: created from the record, given to the player and attached. It is a visual
-- with no inventory entry and no save weight -- which is right for something that is simply always
-- there. Preview items do not survive a load, so the tick re-asserts it; that costs one GetItemInSlot.
--
-- AddItemToSlot is ASYNCHRONOUS: measured, GetItemInSlot still reads nil in the tick the attach returns
-- true, and the belt is there a moment later. So a success is not re-checked immediately -- otherwise
-- every attach looks like a failure and the next tick attaches a second belt.
