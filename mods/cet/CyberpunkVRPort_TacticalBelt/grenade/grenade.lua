-- CyberpunkVRPort — THE GRENADE IN THE HAND.
--
-- Taking one off the belt, holding it, and putting it back. Its own file because it is not the belt:
-- the belt is components on a garment, and this is a grip button, an item in a hand slot and a pose
-- rewritten every frame. The reload module made the same cut for its revolver, for the same reason.
--
-- WHAT CROSSES THE BOUNDARY, and nothing else:
--   E.CFG, E.S          the belt's config and state -- the grab keeps its state in E.S.grab because
--                       two places outside this file read it: applyElements hides the element that is
--                       in the hand, and playerPlane must not count our own prop as a weapon
--   E.log               the module's log
--   E.propItem          which prop entity the equipped grenade wants, and the record pointed at it
--   E.propAllowSlot     the slot whitelist on that record -- a hand slot is not on it by default
--   E.playerPlane       scene or weapon, which decides how the item is attached
--   E.eulerQuat         the panel's degrees to the engine's quaternion
--   E.transactions      the transaction system, cached by the belt
--
-- Driven from init.lua:  GRENADE.tick(now, dt)  every frame,  GRENADE.release(pl)  to force it back.

-- EVERY TOP-LEVEL NAME IN THIS FILE, DECLARED ONCE, HERE.
--
-- The bodies below are in whatever order the work happened to leave them, and that is fine:
-- with the names already local, a function written above the state it reads still sees it.
-- Without this the file needed its declarations sorted by hand, and an hour of moving blocks
-- to satisfy that produced thirty names that resolved as nil globals -- `pinS`, `holdNow`,
-- `playSnd`, `gripDown` and the rest -- each of which killed the grab tick on the frame it
-- was reached. Nothing here changes what the code does; it changes when its names exist.

-- FORWARD-DECLARED, AT THE TOP, and it has to be at the top rather than merely "before holdNow".
--
-- `poseApply` and `grenadeHoldPose` both ask which hold is in force, and `holdNow` is defined far
-- below because it needs the per-type table. A name that is not yet a local resolves as a GLOBAL and
-- is nil, so every frame with a grenade in hand logged
--
--     grenade.lua:218: attempt to call global 'holdNow' (a nil value)
--
-- and the grab tick died there: no transform was ever written and the grenade sat wherever the slot
-- put it. The first attempt at this fix put the declaration on line 286 -- above `holdNow` but BELOW
-- `grenadeHoldPose` on line 200 -- and changed nothing, which is why it goes here.


-- THE FLIGHT is its own file: it is a ballistic integrator with a swept ray, and it has nothing to do
-- with hands, pins or levers.

-- flushed, and absence proved nothing either time.

--             wrist. The wrist and not the ring, because the wrist is what can be measured on a live
--             player; the fingers reach the rest of the way.
--   PULL_DIR  the direction the free hand leaves in: 393 mm in 0.11 s, about 3.6 m/s.
-- IN THE GRENADE'S OWN FRAME, not the wrist's -- and that is the whole of why the first attempt never
-- triggered. The take was recorded with VRIK off, where the wrist is animation-driven; with VRIK on
-- the player's wrist is wherever the tracker says, at whatever roll, so a point stored in ITS frame
-- lands somewhere the hand never goes. The grenade is different: this module puts it there, so its
-- frame is known exactly and means the same in both worlds.
--
--   PIN_P     THE RING ITSELF, out of the geometry: the bounding-box centre of the grenade's own
--             `..._safe_pin_01` mesh, 22 mm from the item's origin. Every part of the prop shares one
--             transform -- each piece's place is baked into its own mesh -- so a part's bbox centre in
--             mesh space IS where that part sits relative to the item.
--
--             The first version put this at 65 mm, taken from where the recorded FINGERS were, and it
--             held the hand three to four centimetres short of the ring. Fingers approach a thing;
--             they do not sit on its centre. The geometry does not have that problem.
--   PULL_DIR  where the pinch goes when it tears away: 441 mm in 0.11 s, from the take.
--
-- BY THE FINGERS AND NOT THE WRIST, which is the whole of why the first two attempts never armed: the
-- pinch sits 98 mm ahead of the wrist, so with the fingers already ON the ring the wrist still reads
-- 115 mm away -- "когда пальцы на чеке пишет 0.115". Measuring the hand by its wrist and then asking

--
-- Everything the hand does is projected onto it, and that answers three complaints at once: circling
-- the hand carried the pin around with it (a circle has no component along the axis, so now it moves
-- nothing), the pin drifted sideways out of its hole, and pushing forward drove it back INTO the
-- grenade -- which the clamp at zero below now forbids.
