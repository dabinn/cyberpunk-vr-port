// steering) published thirteen of these into the shared block because it had to cross from the hands
// plugin to the dxgi proxy; that proxy is gone and both ends are this one DLL now, so the only thing
// still crossing a boundary is the armed mask the CET mods read (vrshared::kWheelArmedMask).
//
// Atomic because the producer and the consumers are different threads: the pose hook writes them on
// the engine's animation thread, the XInput detour reads them on the input thread and the overlay on
// the present thread.

//                      wheel, and three lines later the segment lengths are rescaled and it stops

//                      clavicle write, no cache entry.
//   WheelStoreTarget   the controller target this solve built, which is what the NEXT solve measures
//                      against the animated hand. Must keep being recorded while the arm is handed
//                      over, or letting go could never re-arm. Before hand-stop constraints.
//   WheelBlendTarget   blends the IK target toward the animated hand. A no-op at blend 0.
//   WheelPublishGrab   after both arm blocks: fresh ownership/radius only.
